This is a console Application.

You can run this application and it'll ask you to write a letter (SKU) of the product you want to scan.

Once done scanning, you type 'exit' and it'll return you the Total Savings and Total Cost of the items scanned.

If there's an item that doesn't exist, the app will notify you.

There are unit tests included in this application which can be ran.
